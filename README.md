Notes
-----

You may have noticed **I don't use a src, css, view, controller, etc folders**. That is because I feel the new direction (or the one designed by this project) points out that it makes far more sense to keep modules small and together than to separate them across your code base. With AngularJS, your HTML and JS (and less so CSS) is so closely tied together that I believe this should be a new project structure paradigm in order to maximize scalability.
