AngularJS-ORM - Example of scalable architecture
=============

The project demonstrates ways to **leverage ui-router to the greatest of it's abilities**, how to **keep your controllers down to 1 line of code**, how to **organize your services** in a completely simplified manner, and how to **leverage resolves** like a god. Keeping your application down to a **tiny handful of directives**. Avoid the nightmare of lifecycle, transition, and session/stateful bugs. How to **keep your `$scope` clean and tidy**. It doesn't require using `controller as` and it **doesn't turn everything into directives**. Write your code to be **angular-agnostic**. Use the router to **manage state, sessions and collections** allowing you to avoid the problems addressed with complicated flux architectures. Sharing references means **no more watchers and subscribers** strewn across your app.
